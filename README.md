# Cyberchat

こんにちは,

Primarily, Python and MySQL has been used for this project. Essentially I made a chatapp which has basic functions for chatting and also can share video, screen etc. First make sure you have downloaded the following modules in the requirements.txt. and then run the main.py python file in your editor or the terminal. 

輸入:
For this project I have made many functions like to delete the chat, update the chat, to stream you camera, screen etc. The modules used for this project is tkinter, pandas, pymysql, socket, threading and vidstream

the update and delete button are glitchy anyone finding out the problem can always help 

さようなら
